commands_args_env:
  correct_questions:
  - create a pod manifest named 'envfrom-cm'. the pod should have a container named
    'c' that uses the 'busybox' image. configure the container to import all key-value
    pairs from the configmap named 'app-cm' as environment variables.
  - '**scenario:** in kubernetes, you often need to run a container with a different
    command than the one specified in its dockerfile. for example, you might want
    to run a one-off debugging script, or start a database container with a custom
    configuration flag. you can override a container''s default startup instruction
    (`entrypoint`) and its default arguments (`cmd`) directly in the pod manifest.
    *   `spec.containers.command` overrides the image''s `entrypoint`. *   `spec.containers.args`
    overrides the image''s `cmd`. **your task:** create a pod manifest for a container
    that uses the `busybox` image. your goal is to override its default command to
    make it print the word "hello" to its standard output and then remain running.
    **requirements:** 1.  **pod name:** the pod should be named `cmd-args`. 2.  **image:**
    use the `busybox` image. 3.  **command:** the container should execute a shell.
    use the `command` field to set this to `["sh", "-c"]`. 4.  **arguments:** the
    shell should be given a command string to execute. use the `args` field to provide
    a string that first prints "hello" and then sleeps for a long time (e.g., `echo
    hello && sleep 3600`). the `sleep` command ensures the container remains in a
    `running` state for inspection."'
  - create a pod manifest named `args-pod` with a container named `busybox-container`
    using the `busybox` image. override the container's command to be `[`/bin/sh`,
    `-c`]` and its arguments to be `[`echo hello world`]` . the pod should have a
    `restartpolicy` of `never`.

  correct_questions:
  - create a manifest for a pod named 'simple-pod'. the pod should use the 'nginx:1.21-alpine'
    image and have a label 'app=webserver'.
  - create a new pod named 'nginx' using the 'nginx:alpine' image.
  - delete the 'nginx' pod and the 'nginx-service'.
