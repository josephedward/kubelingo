question: Update the existing ConfigMap 'app-settings' by adding a new data item 'env=production'.
rationale: This question assesses the candidate's ability to update existing ConfigMaps
  in Kubernetes. In real-world scenarios, it is common to need to add or modify configurations
  dynamically without recreating resources. CKAD candidates should understand how
  to perform these modifications efficiently.
