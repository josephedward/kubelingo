# Kubelingo ML Roadmap

This document outlines potential ideas for incorporating machine learning into Kubelingo to create a more personalized and effective learning experience. The ideas are organized by increasing complexity.

### Idea 1: Adaptive Question Selection with Topic Weighting (Low Complexity)

*   **Concept:** The system learns which CKAD topics (e.g., "Core Workloads," "Services," "Persistence") are the user's weakest and prioritizes questions from those areas. The goal is to ensure a user's knowledge is balanced and they don't just over-practice what they already know.
*   **How it could work:**
    1.  **Data Tracking:** The `user_data/performance.yaml` file would track correct/incorrect answers for each question, and each question is already categorized by its source file (e.g., `services.yaml`).
    2.  **ML Model (Simple Algorithm):** This isn't "deep learning" but a classic learning algorithm. Maintain a "mastery score" for each topic (e.g., `services: 0.9`, `persistence: 0.4`).
    3.  **Question Selection:** When selecting a new question, instead of picking a topic randomly, use the inverse of the mastery scores as weights. Topics with lower scores (e.g., `persistence` at 40%) have a much higher probability of being chosen.
    4.  **Decay/Diversity:** To prevent the system from getting stuck on one topic, a decay factor could be added. The weight of a topic is slightly reduced each time it's presented, ensuring other topics eventually surface.

### Idea 2: Dynamic Difficulty Scaling within Topics (Medium Complexity)

*   **Concept:** Within a single topic, questions have varying levels of difficulty. The system learns the user's proficiency and presents them with questions that are appropriately challenging, progressing from simple commands to complex multi-resource manifests.
*   **How it could work:**
    1.  **Data Annotation:** Each question in the YAML files would be manually annotated with a difficulty rating (e.g., `difficulty: easy` or `difficulty: 3`). `easy` could be a `kubectl run` command, while `hard` could be a `Deployment` with affinity rules and a `Service` manifest.
    2.  **User Skill Model:** The system maintains a "skill rating" for the user, possibly for each topic. This could be a simple numerical score.
    3.  **Progression Logic:** When a user correctly answers a question of a certain difficulty, their skill rating increases, and the system is more likely to serve a question of the same or next-highest difficulty. If they fail, the rating decreases, and they are presented with an easier question to reinforce fundamentals. This is a simplified application of concepts from Item Response Theory (IRT).

### Idea 3: Common Error Pattern Recognition and Hinting (Medium-High Complexity)

*   **Concept:** The system analyzes a user's incorrect answers (both commands and manifests) to identify common patterns of mistakes and provide specific, actionable hints.
*   **How it could work:**
    1.  **Data Collection:** Store incorrect user-submitted YAML or command strings.
    2.  **Pattern Analysis (Rule-Based to ML):**
        *   **Simple:** Use `diff` between the user's submission and the solution. If the diff is only in the `apiVersion` field, the hint could be: "Hint: Check the `apiVersion`. `apps/v1` is common for Deployments."
        *   **Advanced (ML):** Use techniques like clustering on embeddings of incorrect answers. For example, many users might incorrectly use `port` instead of `targetPort` in a Service manifest. These incorrect manifests would form a "cluster." When a new answer falls into this cluster, the system provides the targeted hint associated with it.

### Idea 4: Conceptual Gap Analysis via Embeddings (High Complexity)

*   **Concept:** This moves beyond topic labels and analyzes the underlying *Kubernetes concepts* a user struggles with. For example, a user might fail questions across "Core Workloads," "Scheduling," and "Security" that all involve `labels` and `selectors`. The system would identify "labeling and selection" as the core conceptual weakness.
*   **How it could work:**
    1.  **Embedding Generation:** Use a code-aware language model (e.g., a BERT variant) to generate a vector embedding for every question's solution manifest in your library. These embeddings represent the "meaning" of the manifest.
    2.  **User Profile:** When a user fails a question, add its embedding to a "failure profile" for that user.
    3.  **Analysis:** Periodically, run a clustering algorithm (e.g., UMAP for visualization, HDBSCAN for analysis) on the user's failure profile. The resulting clusters represent the conceptual areas of weakness.
    4.  **Targeted Learning:** The system can then report this to the user ("You seem to be struggling with resource attachment and selectors") and create a study session with questions pulled specifically from that conceptual cluster.

### Idea 5: Generative Question Augmentation (Very High Complexity)

*   **Concept:** The ultimate step in personalization. The system uses a generative AI model to create entirely new, unique questions that are precisely tailored to fill a user's identified knowledge gaps.
*   **How it could work:**
    1.  **Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) on your existing library of questions. The model learns the structure, style, and components of a good `kubelingo` question (scenario, task, solution manifest, validation commands).
    2.  **Targeted Prompting:** Using the output from Idea #4, the system would prompt the fine-tuned LLM. For example: "Generate a new, medium-difficulty question for Kubelingo. The scenario must involve a Deployment and a PersistentVolumeClaim. The core concept to test is mounting a volume into a specific `subPath` in the container."
    3.  **Generation and Validation:** The LLM would generate the full question YAML. A critical and difficult final step would be a robust validation pipeline to ensure the generated manifest is syntactically correct, deployable, and that the validation commands work as expected.
