  question: Create a Pod manifest named `args-pod` with a container named `busybox-container`
    using the `busybox` image. Override the container's command to be `[/bin/sh, -c]`
    and its arguments to be `[echo Hello world]` . The Pod should have a `restartPolicy`
    of `Never`.

  question: '**Scenario:** In Kubernetes, you often need to run a container with a
    different command than the one specified in its Dockerfile. For example, you might
    want to run a one-off debugging script, or start a database container with a custom
    configuration flag. You can override a container''s default startup instruction
    (`ENTRYPOINT`) and its default arguments (`CMD`) directly in the Pod manifest.
    *   `spec.containers.command` overrides the image''s `ENTRYPOINT`. *   `spec.containers.args`
    overrides the image''s `CMD`. **Your Task:** Create a Pod manifest for a container
    that uses the `busybox` image. Your goal is to override its default command to
    make it print the word "hello" to its standard output and then remain running.
    **Requirements:** 1.  **Pod Name:** The Pod should be named `cmd-args`. 2.  **Image:**
    Use the `busybox` image. 3.  **Command:** The container should execute a shell.
    Use the `command` field to set this to `["sh", "-c"]`. 4.  **Arguments:** The
    shell should be given a command string to execute. Use the `args` field to provide
    a string that first prints "hello" and then sleeps for a long time (e.g., `echo
    hello && sleep 3600`). The `sleep` command ensures the container remains in a
    `Running` state for inspection."'

  question: Create a Pod manifest named 'envfrom-cm'. The Pod should have a container
    named 'c' that uses the 'busybox' image. Configure the container to import all
    key-value pairs from the ConfigMap named 'app-cm' as environment variables.
