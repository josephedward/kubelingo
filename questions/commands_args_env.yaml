  - question: "Create a pod named 'env-pod' with image 'busybox' that runs the command 'echo $(GREETING) $(NAME)!' and has two environment variables: GREETING=Hello and NAME=World. The pod should print 'Hello World!' to its logs and should not restart after completion."
    solution: |
      kubectl run env-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never -it --rm --env="GREETING=Hello" --env="NAME=World" -- /bin/sh -c 'echo $(GREETING) $(NAME)!'
  - question: "Create a Pod manifest for a container named 'c' using the 'busybox'
    image. Override the container's command to be `['sh', '-c']` and its arguments
    to be `['echo hello && sleep 3600']`."

      **Scenario:**

      In Kubernetes, you often need to run a container with a different command than the one specified in its Dockerfile. For example, you might want to run a one-off debugging script, or start a database container with a custom configuration flag.

      You can override a container's default startup instruction (`ENTRYPOINT`) and its default arguments (`CMD`) directly in the Pod manifest.

      *   `spec.containers.command` overrides the image's `ENTRYPOINT`.
      *   `spec.containers.args` overrides the image's `CMD`.

      **Your Task:**

      Create a Pod manifest for a container that uses the `busybox` image. Your goal is to override its default command to make it print the word "hello" to its standard output and then remain running.

      **Requirements:**

      1.  **Pod Name:** The Pod should be named `cmd-args`.
      2.  **Image:** Use the `busybox` image.
      3.  **Command:** The container should execute a shell. Use the `command` field to set this to `["sh", "-c"]`.
      4.  **Arguments:** The shell should be given a command string to execute. Use the `args` field to provide a string that first prints "hello" and then sleeps for a long time (e.g., `echo hello && sleep 3600`). The `sleep` command ensures the container remains in a `Running` state for inspection."

  - question: "Create a Pod manifest named 'envfrom-cm'. The Pod should have a container
    named 'c' that uses the 'busybox' image. Configure the container to import
    all key-value pairs from the ConfigMap named 'app-cm' as environment variables."
