    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is almost correct, but it is missing the container name parameter. The correct command should include the container name parameter as shown in the suggested answer:\n```\nkubectl logs -n mynamespace mypod -c <container_name>\n```\nMake sure to include the `-c <container_name>` part to specify the specific container whose logs you want to check."
