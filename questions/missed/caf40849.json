    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is incorrect. The correct answer is true. With Kubernetes, you can update the image of a pod without restarting the pod by using the `kubectl set image` command or by updating the pod's YAML file with the new image version and then applying the changes with `kubectl apply`. This allows you to perform rolling updates to pods in a controlled manner without causing downtime."
