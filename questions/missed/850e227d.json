    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is incorrect. The suggested answer is true. A liveness probe is indeed used to determine if a container is healthy and should continue running, while a readiness probe is used to determine if a container is ready to start accepting traffic. It's important to understand the distinction between these two types of probes in Kubernetes for effective container management."
