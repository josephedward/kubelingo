    "question_type": "command",
    "user_answer": "k logs pod my-pod -c my-container",
    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is almost correct. The correct command to view the logs of a specific container within a Pod is `kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>`. So the correct command in this case would be `kubectl logs my-pod -c my-container`. Just a small typo with the command 'k' instead of 'kubectl'. Other than that, your answer is accurate."
