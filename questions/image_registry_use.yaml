questions:
- question: Create a pod named 'private-pod' that uses an image 'my-registry/my-app:1.0'
    from a private registry. The pod should use an image pull secret named 'reg-secret'.
  source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/
  suggestion:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: private-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: my-registry/my-app:1.0
        name: main
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: reg-secret
- question: Pod manifest with imagePullPolicy Always and using imagePullSecrets regcred.

  suggestion:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: c
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: main
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
- question: Create a pod named 'private-pod' that pulls images from a private repository
    'my-private-repo/my-image:latest' using an image pull secret named 'my-pull-secret'
    and sets the imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent.
  rationale: This question assesses the candidate's ability to create a Pod that pulls
    images from a private repository using an image pull secret, which is a common
    task in real-world Kubernetes deployments. Understanding how to manage image registries
    securely is essential for CKAD-certified developers.
