    "question_type": "command",
    "user_answer": "k describe pod my-pod",
    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is almost correct, but you missed the \"kubectl\" command at the beginning of the command. The correct command should start with \"kubectl describe pod my-pod\". Make sure to include \"kubectl\" before the \"describe\" command to interact with the Kubernetes cluster."
