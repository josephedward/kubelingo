    "ai_feedback": "Your answer is almost correct, but it is missing the `kubectl` command at the beginning. Remember that `kubectl` is the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. So the correct command should be `kubectl get services -n development`. Make sure to include `kubectl` at the beginning of your command to ensure it runs successfully."
