explanation: The `ENTRYPOINT` directive in a Dockerfile sets the executable for the
  container.  If `CMD` is also used, it provides default arguments for `ENTRYPOINT`.
  When running a container with `kubectl`, you can override both `ENTRYPOINT` and
  `CMD` using the `--command` and `--args` flags respectively.
