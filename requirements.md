        "topic": "pods",
        "question": "Create a simple Pod named ‘demo-pod running the latest nginx image" (notice how the exact fields expected match with the answer),

-  Question Menu 
	+ do not write the title of the menu literally
	+ it comes right after the text of the question
	+ quit should bring them back to the main menu 
	+ the line below the menu should be blank, a blank REPL that user can navigate like a normal CLI, users can delete or navigate back/forward with arrow keys, can scroll up to get previously input lines
	+ when a user presses enter (or if the user quits vim), the question should be graded 
	+ once this loop is exited, and the results/feedback is shown, we should always move directly into the post-answer menu (below)
	+ do not want to rely on AI for verdict; but detailed AI feedback is helpful 
	+ if the answer is verbatim the same as the suggested answer, you do not need to show AI feedback
	+ v)im, c)lear, n)ext, p)revious, a)nswer s)ource, q)uit 
	________________(input line)

- AI feedback is shown after the user answers, before the post-answer menu

- Post Answer Menu 
	+ always comes after a question is answered)
	+ AI does not determine correct/missed; feedback is what is important from AI 
	+ user chooses to save as correct or missed, or delete as a bad question 
	+ if the answer is verbatim the same as the suggested answer, you do not need to show AI feedback
	+ r)etry, c)orrect, m)issed, d)elete question 

- kubernetes command and manifest tools
	+ test every single one of them 
	+ make a list of the ones that work 
	+ don't worry about static evaluation 
	+ AI feedback is a critical component

question_flow: 
	• Construct a system+user prompt (e.g. “You are a Kubernetes instructor… generate a true or false statement about <topic>…”)
	• Call our existing ai_chat helper in a loop until we have count unique questions
	• Parse the JSON response into your question dicts with keys id, topic, type: 'tf', question (starting “True or False: …”) and answer ('true' or 'false')
	• Filter out any questions already in correct_folder
