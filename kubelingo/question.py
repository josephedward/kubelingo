    Canonical question object for all exercises.

    This schema supports several core question modalities, identified by the `type` field.
    The `type` dictates which fields are required for the question to be solvable.

    Supported types:
    - 'socratic': Open-ended conceptual questions for AI-driven tutoring.
        - Required: `prompt`.
    - 'command': Single-line command quizzes (e.g., kubectl, helm, vim).
        - Required: `prompt`.
        - Solvable with: `answers` (list of valid commands) OR `validation_steps`.
    - 'basic_terminology': Questions about definitions and concepts.
        - Required: `prompt`.
        - Solvable with: `answers` (list of correct terms/phrases).
    - 'yaml_author': Create a YAML manifest from scratch.
        - Required: `prompt`.
        - Solvable with: `correct_yaml`.
    - 'yaml_edit': Edit a template YAML to meet requirements.
        - Required: `prompt`, `initial_files`.
        - Solvable with: `correct_yaml`.
    - 'live_k8s_edit': Apply/edit manifests on a live cluster and run checks.
        - Required: `prompt`.
        - Solvable with: `validation_steps`.
