Here are three full example API calls to the Perplexity API for generating CKAD-related Kubernetes questions and answersâ€”one each for trivia, command-based, and manifest-based questions. The examples include precise curl or Python payloads and illustrate the format for requesting complete answers via a stable API.

## Example 1: Trivia Question (Curl)

This demonstrates requesting a **Kubernetes CKAD trivia question and its answer**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "model": "sonar-medium-online",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Generate a complete Kubernetes CKAD trivia question and answer. Include all details necessary to answer."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Give me a CKAD exam-style trivia question about Kubernetes namespaces. Provide the answer directly."
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 500,
    "temperature": 0.4
  }'
```
Example Result:
```
Question: What is the purpose of namespaces in Kubernetes and how can you list all available namespaces in a cluster?
Answer: Namespaces in Kubernetes are used for dividing cluster resources between multiple users, teams, or projects. To list all namespaces, use the command: kubectl get namespaces
```


## Example 2: Command Question (Python)

Requesting a **Kubernetes CKAD question that expects a command as an answer**:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY"
url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
payload = {
    "model": "sonar-medium-online",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Provide concise, precise answers."}, 
        {"role": "user", "content": "Ask a CKAD exam-style question that requires providing a kubectl command. State the full question and answer."} 
    ],
    "max_tokens": 400
}
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
print(response.json())
```
Example Result (formatted for readability):
```
Question: How do you set the active Kubernetes namespace to 'development' using kubectl?
Answer: kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=development
```


## Example 3: Manifest Question (Curl)

Requesting a **Kubernetes CKAD question that requires writing or providing a manifest**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "model": "sonar-medium-online",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Provide detailed answers and complete YAML manifests."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Ask a CKAD exam-style question that requires creating a Pod running nginx container. Provide the full manifest as the answer."
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 600
  }'
```
Example Result:
```
Question: Write a Kubernetes manifest for a Pod named 'nginx-pod' running the nginx image. The Pod should be in the 'default' namespace.

Answer:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

### Additional Notes

- Replace `YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` with the correct key from the Perplexity dashboard.
- The endpoint and payload style shown here is OpenAI-compatible (with minor tweaks as per Perplexity docs) and tested in production scenarios.[1][2][3][4]
- Questions are constructed to guarantee the answer includes all necessary details for CKAD standards.[5][6]

These templates can be adapted, ensuring every question gives the complete context and answer, suitable for automation or testing purposes.
