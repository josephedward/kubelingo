## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test main CLI entry points
- [ ] Test argument parsing validation
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test user interaction flows
- [ ] Achieve >80% coverage for CLI module

## Priority
Critical - needed for reliability" --label "testing,enhancement"

gh issue create --title "Improve YAML Structure Validation Logic" --body "Enhance the YAML validation to support comprehensive Kubernetes schema checks.

## Description
The current YAML validation only checks for the presence of basic keys like \`apiVersion\`, \`kind\`, and \`metadata\`. We need to implement more robust validation against the Kubernetes API schema to provide more accurate feedback.

## Tasks
- [ ] Integrate a Kubernetes schema validation library
- [ ] Validate resource types against their official schemas
- [ ] Check for deprecated API versions
- [ ] Provide detailed error messages for validation failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] YAML validation covers all standard Kubernetes resources
- [ ] Validation errors are specific and actionable
- [ ] The system can handle custom resource definitions (CRDs) gracefully

## Priority
Medium - improves core functionality" --label "validation,enhancement"

gh issue create --title "Enhance Command Equivalence Logic" --body "Improve the logic for comparing user-provided 'kubectl' commands with expected solutions.

## Description
The current command comparison logic is basic and only normalizes whitespace. It should be enhanced to understand 'kubectl' command structures, including aliases, argument order, and shorthand flags.

## Tasks
- [ ] Parse 'kubectl' commands into a structured format
- [ ] Compare command components (resource, verb, flags) semantically
- [ ] Handle common aliases (e.g., 'po' for 'pods')
- [ ] Ignore non-essential differences in flag order

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command comparison is robust and flexible
- [ ] Correctly validates a wider range of user inputs
- [ ] The system correctly identifies equivalent but non-identical commands

## Priority
Medium - improves user experience" --label "validation,enhancement"

gh issue create --title "Add Developer Documentation" --body "Create comprehensive developer documentation to streamline onboarding and contributions.

## Description
To encourage community contributions and make maintenance easier, we need clear documentation for developers. This should cover project setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

## Tasks
- [ ] Write a \`CONTRIBUTING.md\` guide
- [ ] Document the project architecture and module interactions
- [ ] Provide instructions for setting up the development environment
- [ ] Explain the process for running tests and adding new ones

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A clear and comprehensive \`CONTRIBUTING.md\` exists
- [ ] New developers can set up the project and run tests successfully
- [ ] The documentation is sufficient to guide the addition of new features

## Priority
High - developer experience" --label "documentation,developer-experience"

gh issue create --title "Implement CI/CD Pipeline" --body "Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and releases.

## Description
A CI/CD pipeline will improve code quality and development velocity by automating routine tasks. The pipeline should run tests on every pull request and facilitate automated releases.

## Tasks
- [ ] Set up a GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Configure the pipeline to run linters and formatters
- [ ] Add a step to run the full test suite
- [ ] Automate building binaries for different platforms
- [ ] (Optional) Set up automated releases to GitHub

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests are automatically run for all pull requests
- [ ] The pipeline provides clear feedback on test failures
- [ ] The build process is automated and reliable
