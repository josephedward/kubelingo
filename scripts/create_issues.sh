gh issue create --title "Comprehensive CLI Testing" --body "Add tests for main entry points, argument parsing, and error handling

## Description
The current CLI module lacks comprehensive test coverage. We need to add tests for:

- Main entry point logic
- Argument parsing edge cases  
- Session initialization
- Error handling and user feedback
- Configuration management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test main CLI entry points
- [ ] Test argument parsing validation
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Test user interaction flows
- [ ] Achieve >80% coverage for CLI module

## Priority
Critical - needed for reliability" --label "testing,enhancement"

gh issue create --title "YAML Editing Workflow Tests" --body "Mock vim subprocess calls and test file I/O operations

## Description
The YAML editing workflow currently has minimal test coverage. We need comprehensive tests that mock external dependencies.

## Tasks
- [ ] Mock vim subprocess calls
- [ ] Test file I/O operations
- [ ] Validate exercise generation
- [ ] Test validation feedback loops
- [ ] Test error recovery scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All YAML editing workflows tested
- [ ] Subprocess calls properly mocked
- [ ] File operations tested
- [ ] >85% coverage for VimYamlEditor

## Priority
High - core functionality" --label "testing,yaml-editing"
